			<p>Now, look through the entire collection. We have suggested four categories into which you should sort the covers. There are no ‘correct’ answers, and images may fall into more than one category. After sorting all the images, follow-up questions and short video clips will help you think through those categories in more detail.</p>

			<p><strong>Cinema and Montage:</strong> Which covers feature allusions or references to cinema, and/or use the artistic technique of montage?</p>

			<p><strong>Traditional Dress and Cosmetics:</strong> Which covers seem to incorporate traditional elements of clothing or appearance?</p>

			<p><strong>Home and Family:</strong> Which covers focus on family life, or show women inside the home?</p>

			<p><strong>Modern women:</strong> Which covers emphasize the independence and sophistication of modern women?</p>
